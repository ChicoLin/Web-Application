==================

Commit graded: 05528cc2be06409e6ec323b95d804231cb8b0721  


### Grumblr design process (5/10)

  * -5, Evidence of design iteration is missing from your submission. After receiving feedback, you should have revised your design and submitted the edited wireframes alongside the originals.  

### Demonstrates basic familiarity with HTML and CSS

#### Completeness: Solution meets basic specification (11/15)

  * -1, Grumblr posts should indicate who posted them.  
  * -3, It’s unclear from the UI how a user would make a new post.  

#### Demonstrates understanding of HTML/CSS (14/15)

  * -1, `<title>` tags for each page should contain a short textual description of what page the user is actually on. For instance, a login page could be title ‘Login’.  
  * -0.1, There are validation errors in your grumblr HTML.  High-quality HTML should always be validated using [https://validator.w3.org/] to ensure that it meets the HTML standards.  


### Appropriate use of course infrastructure and Git (10/10)

  * -0, In the future we would like to see slightly more granularity in your commits. It will benefit you to commit early and commit often. Because the design process and Grumblr implementation include many independent changes, a truly effective use of version control would contain many additional commits, at least one for each independent change.
