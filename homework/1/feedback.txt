Login Page:
1.The function of the upper-left button (three horizontal lines) is not specified？The search button on the upper-right is not neccessary？

Global Stream Page:
1. The hint in the search field "Search post" should be changed to "Search…"
2. add “New Post” feature
3. The "Archive" button in the post block should be -> like, comment, share, favorite, and more.


Profile Page:
1. Add features: “add friend/ delete friend”, “Chat”, for other users (not the user himself). 
2. There should be a place for profile background picture.
