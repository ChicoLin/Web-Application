To turn in homework 5, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

1. The webapp support 5-second refreshing for both posts and comments
2. To comment, you must click on the "Comment" button. Hitting Enter key won't work (since it's not required).
3. You can always click on the "Grumblr" navigation brand in the upper-left corner to go to the global_stream page. You can follow/ unfollow another user or edit your own profile only from the "Profile" page.
4. Posts deleting is not working now. I haven't figured out how to display the "Delete" button from the Model returned HTML. (But this is not required)
5. Other features are the same with hwk4. If you have confusions, please refer t
o the README file in hwk4.
